# House-price-prediction

This README file provides the details about the the group project 'house price prediction' completed as part of the university coursework.

### Project objective

The aim of the project is to build a model that can predict the price of the house by giving in the attribute that show high correlation value to the output price.
Another main goal of this thesis is to examine the importance of each predictor in explaining price variation for a given set of housing attributes.
Our approach is to prepare the collected raw data and do primary exploration analysis. After the basic visualisation is done the data is pre-processed. The data is then split into two parts. The first part trains
the model and produces an inferred function. The second part of the data tests the accuracy of the model thus build. Both the data sets are subject to various regression models. Finally, the accuracy
score is evaluated across the models. 

### code

The coding is done in Python and implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

### Report
